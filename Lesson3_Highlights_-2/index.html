            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a way to record changes to one file or set of files over time so that you can recall any specific version later, instead of saving many files with different dates and names. Saving several files with dates and names can be possible, but if you are dealing with hundreds of files, you can have one main repository for all of the project files through version control. Version control also allows team members to check files out, make changes to them, and them check them back in. This solves file-sharing problems. One example is you can use version control if you are wen designer and want to save every version of a web layout.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If a file is changed, version control systems automatically documents who changed that file in a revision history, as well as when it was changed, what is different even if files were merged, and when the file was merged. They can’t be overwritten and there is a common repository. People can also work on the same files at the same time without any conflict; everyone gets their own version to work on.  Version control systems also allow users to revert back to an older state of a particular file.  Even if you do not work with a team, version control is still beneficial because it allows you to backup your own project.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that we used in this assignment. It is one of the main version control systems because it is free and accessible to the public. It is designed for anything from a small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There are many benefits for Git enabling your project. It is many people’s choice because it creates local branches; through Git every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally, so they can work offline. There is no single point of failure and it will also prevent unintentional overwrites of a file on the shared repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You utilize Git through Git commands. Some basic Git commands are “Git Init”, which initializes the repository. “Git Add” adds all the files that were changed since the last backup. “Git Commit” commits the changes to the repository. “Git Push” pushes the changes in local repository to the remote repository. “Git Pull” pulls the changes in a remote repository to the local repository. “Git Clone” clones a remote repository. “Git Log” shows all the backups created in the repository. “Git Status” shows all files that were changed since the last backup. “Git blame” shows who wrote which line of code, and “Git Diff” shows the differences between the working directory and the back ups created in the repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Git repository is the one place where the history of your work and all your project files are stored. You can initialize a repository in an existing directory by using $ git init, which creates a new subdirectory that contains all the necessary repository files. You can clone or get a copy of an existing repository by using $ git clone, which pulls down every version of every file for the history of the project. This term was confusing for me because during the lesson it was brought up several times without a definition for it, so I had to do my own research.</p>
